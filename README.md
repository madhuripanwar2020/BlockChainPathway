# BlockChainPathway

As a fintech engineer working at one of the five largest banks in the world, I have built
a blockchain-based ledger system with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger

# Technical Information
The following technology platform were used 
1. Python along with libraries dataclasses, Pandas, hashlib. I installed separate library streamlit-aggrid to display the DataFrame
2. Streamlit for user interface

# Application Screen shots


1. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the Add Block button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.

2. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu. See the screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a blockchain that consists of multiple blocks

3. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface. See the screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should indicate the validity of the blockchain.
